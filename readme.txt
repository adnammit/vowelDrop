HANGMAN:

This is just a simple little two-player game where each player tries to 
guess a word that the other player entered with the vowels obscured.
The first one to five points wins!

This was one of my first C++ programs and one of my first attempts 
at modularity, dividing the work of the program into small, simple
functions. 


RUNNING IT:

There is only one source file and one make file for this program. 
From the command line, simply type "make" and then "./play".

To recompile after making changes, type "make" again.
To delete all executables, type "make clean".

That's it!
Hope you enjoy my silly program.
